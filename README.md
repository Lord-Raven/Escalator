# Escalator for Chub

This simple stage for chub.ai tracks a single escalation stat, applying a customizable pace value to the stat with each message. It then includes special, escalating keywords in the prompt to trigger lorebook entries, allowing lorebooks to provide different entries as the chat progresses--providing a potential to escalate (or de-escalate) a scenario. In order to achieve anything, this stage must be coupled with a lorebook that leverages these special keywords.
